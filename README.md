# Create a Vacation Planner Web Application in Dart with PostgreSQL
A guide for building a full web application in Dart that can leverage a REST API & save data to a database.

You will build both the client & server for an SPA (Single Page Application).

In this guide, we will avoid using frameworks so we can learn & understand the fundamentals of how a web application works.

We will use Dart (a Java-like language from Google that underpins Flutter) as it enables us to have one language for the entire web application, client and server. This enables code reuse/type checking between client & server code. In larger, mature applications, the advantage of this can't be exaggerated.

Here's a Youtube video explaining Dart in 100 seconds:

#### Prerequisites

You'll need access to a Unix-like environment, such as Mac or Linux.

We will be using the shell quite a bit to fetch dependencies, build & run the application. If you are using Mac, I recommend https://hyper.is/.

You will need to have Dart installed, which can be done [by following these instructions](https://github.com/ailabs-software/learn_vacation_planner/blob/main/install_dart.md).

#### Sharing of your code

Results can be delivered by sharing your work via your own git repo that is hosted on a service such as GitHub, gitlab, etc.

This will enable efficient collaboration to solve any questions & issues you run into along the way.

Creating a git repo will be covered in section 3.

#### What to do if you get stuck

Save your work to a git repo, hosted online, and share a link in email to it.

Send along any error you're running into.



#### Get Started
